  <h2>What This Project Is About</h2>
  <p>
    Project 1 is teaching your team how distributed messaging works using the publish-subscribe model.
    In the final version, your sender (producer) will publish messages to Google Pub/Sub, and your consumer
    will read them from a subscription and save them to a database.
  </p>
  <p>
    The key concept your instructor wants to see is <strong>at-least-once delivery</strong>: a message may be delivered more than once,
    so the consumer must detect duplicates <strong>before</strong> inserting rows into the database.
